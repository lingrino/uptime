# Uptime

A simple site useful for calculating how expected uptime (eg: `99.99%`) translates to allowed downtime in a period (eg: `53 minutes/year`).

This site is built with the following technologies. I chose them because they're new and I wanted to try them out.

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
